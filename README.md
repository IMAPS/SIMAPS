# SIMAPS
SIMAPS (Semantic Interoperability Maturity Assessment of a Public Service) is a user-friendly online questionnaire, designed as a self-assessment tool to assist public service owners to evaluate key semantic interoperability aspects of their digital public service.

Semantic interoperability enables organisations to process information from external sources in a meaningful manner and ensures that the precise meaning of exchanged information is understood and preserved throughout exchanges between different  Public Administrations.  In the context of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF), semantic interoperability also encompasses the syntactic interoperability in the sense of describing the exact format of the information to be exchanged in terms of grammar, format and schemas. 

Semantic interoperability provides also a common understanding of the data, by using common nomenclatures and data formats. It is crucial to agree on the use of common semantic standards, promote transparent and well-documented metadata policies and increase the visibility and reuse of existing semantic interoperability solutions.

SIMAPS is fully compliant with the latest version of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).

SIMAPS serves complementary to the IMAPS survey and its use is recommended in conjunction with IMAPS, to vertically assess the behavioural aspects of a digital public service, from the semantic behavioural interoperability viewpoint. You may visit the latest vesrion of the IMAPS questionnare here: https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/IMAPS-v1_2_0 and the respective documentation can be found in this link https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/imaps-interoperability-maturity-assessment-public-service/solution/imaps/release/v120

On completion of the survey, the public service owners receive tailored feedback and recommendations on how to further improve their service in terms of semantic interoperability.

You may check and test the current version of SIMAPS (SIMAPS v1.0.0) at the EU survey portal: https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/SIMAPS_v_1_0_0 .
